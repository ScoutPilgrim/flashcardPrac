  <h1>Flashcards for leaning JS & jQuery.</h1>
  <div class="container">
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>JavaScript (JS)</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming
          language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Operators</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>, -, *, /, and % are called operators. An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Variables can be thought of as containers used to store information. They allow for a way to label data with a descriptive name.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Variable naming conventions</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Naming conventions, like any programming standard, is not necessary for writing code that runs just fine. In fact, it's entirely within the realm of possibility to have a program developed by a fifteen year old rebel, with no regard for
          any
          conventions or standards that wipes the floor with the code written by a team of seasoned experts. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Functions</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>A function is a block of code that performs an action and returns a result; optionally takes arguments.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>A method is an action run on a piece of data; you can think of it as a message you send to a piece of data, and the result is the response.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Arguments</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Some methods take one or more arguments that provide the method with additional information to help it perform its action.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Parameters</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Return</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>The return statement stops the execution of a function and returns a value from that function.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Chaining methods</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Method chaining is a technique that can be used to simplify code in scenarios that involve calling multiple functions on the same object consecutively.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Strings</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>a JavaScript data type that represents the exact text of whatever is enclosed in the quotes.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Booleans</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>true and false are booleans. They are not strings - they simply represent being true or false.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Undefined</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Undefined is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value. Simply saying, when you create a variable and leave it without assigning a value to it, JavaScript will automatically assign a value called undefined.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>NaN</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>0 / 0; returns NaN, which stands for not a number. NaN is a type of number.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Escape</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>An escape character enables you to output characters you wouldn't normally be able to, usually because the browser will interpret it differently to what you intended. In JavaScript, the backslash ( \ ) is an escape character.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Alert</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>This function will display text in a dialog box that pops up on the screen. We can instruct JavaScript to watch for these events, and if or when they occur, execute the specified function.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Comments</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>Anything following // on a line in JavaScript is ignored by the computer. Comments are a convenient way to leave notes in your code for yourself or other programmers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>jQuery</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>is a JavaScript library that makes it easier to incorporate JavaScript on your web pages. When we say it is a library, we mean that many common tasks that would take many, many lines of JavaScript code to execute have been packaged into
          methods that you'll be able to use with a single line of code. These methods are always available and ready to use the same way you might check out a book at a library. The goal of jQuery is to allow its users to "write less, do more". It's
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="flashcard clickable">
      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <div class="fuckBootstrap">
        <p>The value is one of the property's attributes. These attributes define how the property can be accessed (is it readable?, is it writable?) In JavaScript, all attributes can be read, but only the value attribute can be changed (and only if
          the
          property is writable).</p>
